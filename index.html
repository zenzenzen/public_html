      <p>&nbsp;I think a lot about where I am in my life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The younger generations I'm a part of and the ones right behind me are getting older. 
        Day after day, we're looking ourselves in the mirror and trying to get used to the fact that
        our memories of being young are going to stay memories.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;It's no surprise you get those news stories of millenials doing idiotic things or
        believing in idiotic movements. They were raised by people whose values and ideals ensured
        that they stayed in that kid's mindset. Well, sometimes. It could also be that they're having a 
        hard time adjusting to how quickly the world is moving (and how quickly it's left them behind).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;I've met 35 year olds who either can barely take care of themselves and still cling
        to their nostalgia pop culture icons. I've met others in similar stages of nostalgia mixed in with
        codependency and substance abuse. It's the songs, the movies, the TV, the internet...it's the 
        blame it on the older generations game for ruining the healthcare and jobs market... it's the 
        blame it one the younger generations game for being so smart and sucking up all the entry level
        jobs. Ok, is it? Why am I thinking about that?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;I just turned 26 about a week ago, <em>and I'm afraid of failing myself.</em></p> 
      <p>&nbsp;While, I've a lot of cynicism when I notice someone's speech quickly nose-dive into
        self-victimization, I know that there may exist some societal structures in place that could contribute
        to their current predicament. But that's not what I'm turning my attention towards....
      </p> 
      <p>&nbsp;I'm really wondering everyday if I'm too little, too late to switch fields. Yes, the news
        has me constantly terrified that I won't make it, even if I put a lot of effort into learning how
        to program and code &mdash; I won't make it and I'll wake up like that 35 year old I have nightmares 
        about.
      </p>
      
      <h1 class="section-headers" id="retro-green">Education / Career Goals</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;While I did graduate from University of Washington with a departmental honors degree
        in English and specialized in creative writing, I find myself here learning computer science and 
        coding in the same breath.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;I recently transferred from Las Positas College in Livermore and I guess I'm still pursuing
        a finish to my associates degree since I'm already so far into taking many of the required classes.
        What I'm really after is using the classes that I'm taking right now as a general practice-study 
        spring board for learning the more complex concepts of web development and software design in general.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;I intend to keep up the practice and code for long stretches every day. These classes are 
        essentially a lot of practice for me to strengthen and stay strong on the skills I need to form
        a more solid base for more advanced topics in software development. There's a distinction between a
        developer and a software engineer, and I've yet to learn enough to start picking sides on which skillsets
        I really want to hone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Right now, in addition to 14 credits, I'm also teaching myself the intricacies of
        web based client-server scripting languages through some projects. It's more of a reach goal, but I intend
        to have somethings completed before the end of this semester. I intend to master more of the basics so 
        that I can keep rounding out my currently superficial knowledge of computing/computer science.
