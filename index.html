                  <h1 class="section-headers" id="ide-pink">Introduction</h1>
                  <p>&nbsp;I think a lot about where I am in my life.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;The younger generations I'm a part of and the ones right behind me are getting older. 
                    Day after day, we're looking ourselves in the mirror and trying to get used to the fact that
                    our memories of being young are going to stay memories.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;It's no surprise you get those news stories of millenials doing idiotic things or
                    believing in idiotic movements. They were raised by people whose values and ideals ensured
                    that they stayed in that kid's mindset <em>(Gen X-ers, Boomers, cough, cough)</em>. Well, sometimes. It could also be that they're having a 
                    hard time adjusting to how quickly the world is moving (and how quickly it's left them behind).
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;I've met 35 year olds who either can barely take care of themselves and still cling
                    to their nostalgia pop culture icons. I've met others in similar stages of nostalgia mixed in with
                    codependency and substance abuse. It's the songs, the movies, the TV, the internet...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &nbsp; Meanwhile, on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit etc... Millenials and Gen Z-ers are all meme-ing away at how anxious, depressed, out of it, and insecure we all are at our futures and prospects. We're making each other laugh while we're crying. Crying while we're laughing because the memes are true and funny and they resonate with something that hurts inside.
                  </p>
                  <p>But really, when it comes down to the wire, the world doesn't owe us anything. So is it just the decisions that we've made before we were ready to make them that screwed some of us over? 
                  </p>
                    <p>Did <strong>I</strong> not make the right decisions?</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;
                      <em>I'm afraid of failing myself.</em> Maybe it's that.
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Is all this too little, too late to switch fields? Yes, the news has me constantly terrified that I won't make it, even if I put a lot of effort into learning how to program and code &mdash; I won't make it and I'll wake up like that 35 year old I have nightmares 
                    about. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &nbsp;Ever the cautious optimist, I think it's time to let go of these thoughts and do what Shia Lebouf said in that meme video:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    "Don't let your dreams be dreams. Just do it!"
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    As a millenial, it's only appropriate I take life advice from a meme.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1 class="section-headers" id="retro-green">Education / Career Goals</h1>
                  <p>&nbsp;While I did graduate from University of Washington with a departmental honors degree
                    in English and specialized in creative writing, I find myself here learning computer science and 
                    coding in the same breath.
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;I recently transferred from Las Positas College in Livermore and I guess I'm still pursuing
                    a finish to my associates degree since I'm already so far into taking many of the required classes.
                    What I'm really after is using the classes that I'm taking right now as a general practice-study 
                    spring board for learning the more complex concepts of web development and software design in general.
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;I intend to keep up the practice and code for long stretches every day. These classes are 
                    essentially a lot of practice for me to strengthen and stay strong on the skills I need to form
                    a more solid base for more advanced topics in software development. There's a distinction between a
                    developer and a software engineer, and I've yet to learn enough to start picking sides on which skillsets
                    I really want to hone.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;Right now, in addition to 14 credits, I'm also teaching myself the intricacies of
                    web based client-server scripting languages through some projects. It's more of a reach goal, but I intend
                    to have somethings completed before the end of this semester. I intend to master more of the basics so 
                    that I can keep rounding out my currently superficial knowledge of computing/computer science.
